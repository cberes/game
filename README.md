A Basic LWJGL project. Maybe eventually a sweet video game will be here.

The Gradle build script was adapted from these links:

- http://wiki.lwjgl.org/wiki/Setting_Up_LWJGL_with_Maven
- https://discuss.gradle.org/t/how-to-use-lwjgl-or-how-to-use-native-libraries/7498

# Usage

Launch the app with Gradle to detect the correct native libraries.

    gradle run
