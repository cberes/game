A Basic LWJGL project. Maybe eventually a sweet video game will be here.

The Gradle build script was adapted from these links:

- http://wiki.lwjgl.org/wiki/Setting_Up_LWJGL_with_Maven
- https://discuss.gradle.org/t/how-to-use-lwjgl-or-how-to-use-native-libraries/7498

# Usage

Launch the app with Gradle to detect the correct native libraries.

    gradle run

# Info

I'm developing this by following [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS8wlS9hF8E&list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP) by [ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix). However, LWJGL 3 is used instead of LWJGL 2.
